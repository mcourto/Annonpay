            <h2>User Journey</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The user visits your website and is prompted to log in using their credentials. (This plus the alias would need to be provided to a user, a better option might be to create a one time usage link that has all of this data hidden)</li>
                <li>After successful login, the user is presented with a form to input an alias associated with their pre-registered PayID.</li>
                <li>The user fills in the alias and submits the form.</li>
                <li>The user is then directed to a secure payment page where they enter their payment details (e.g., credit card information) to complete the transaction. (This would actually redirect to stripe otherwise it’s too dodgy looking)</li>
                <li>Once the payment is successful, the system retrieves the corresponding PayID from the backend based on the provided alias.</li>
                <li>The system automatically purchases TON crypto using the provided funds through a connected crypto exchange (e.g., Binance).</li>
                <li>After the TON crypto is purchased, the system initiates a withdrawal, transferring the TON to a hardcoded wallet address in the background.</li>
                <li>The TON crypto is received in the hardcoded wallet, completing the transaction.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Create or utilise a new “mixer” (move around different wallets and coins till it’s untraceable) the benefit of doing this on the TON Defi network is you could also automate the process of minting your own coin as part of the process and pump and dump it till it’s worthless and would fly under the radar)</p>
            <p>Other options are using liquidity pools and farms and automate the profit withdrawals</p>
            <p>You can also utilise gaming (whale) casinos as the blockchain doesn’t look at winnings or losses as they happen rather just the input and output, but the input and output wallet doesn’t need to be the same, cab withdraw small amount to x amount of wallets (this is basically a mixer unless there is some type of audit that is added to the blockchain but currently it’s not)</p>
            <p>Create own platform that has multiple users, move the money in the back end within the platform with the blockchain (slightly complicated but if user x adds $100, then at the exact point they purchase you send it from the platform back to a wallet you have access to or as part of a novel mixer, but you instantly pay that $100 to them, the front end never knows it nor the blockchain and then it looks like you’ve lose $100 of the $1000 for example that you put in, then you withdraw $100 and there is a audit trail of you losing $900) - might need more thought but the casino or app in out method isn’t currently regulated.</p>

            <h2>Benefits for Anonymous Payments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Privacy: By using an alias associated with a pre-registered PayID, users can make payments without directly revealing their real identity or PayID, enhancing their privacy.</li>
                <li>Convenience: Users can easily make payments using their existing banking details and a simple alias, without the need to create additional accounts or go through extensive verification processes.</li>
                <li>Security: The system utilizes secure payment gateways and encryption to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, the backend holds the PayID, adding an extra layer of security.</li>
                <li>Automation: The entire process, from payment to TON purchase and transfer, is automated, reducing the need for manual intervention and increasing efficiency.</li>
                <li>Anonymity: By transferring the purchased TON directly to a hardcoded wallet address in the background, the system maintains the anonymity of the transaction, as the funds are not held in an intermediary account.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Overall, this system provides a convenient and secure way for users to anonymously purchase TON crypto using their existing banking details and an alias associated with a pre-registered PayID. The backend handling of the PayID adds an extra layer of security and privacy, while the automated process ensures a smooth user experience.</p>

            <h2>Further Thoughts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wallet creation automation with interval changes and mixer logic implementation</li>
                <li>Multi-platform withdrawal system with verified accounts</li>
                <li>Legitimate service provision (e.g., ebooks)</li>
            </ul>
